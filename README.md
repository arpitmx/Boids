# Boids 2D : Flock Simulation 
### Understanding Collective Motion


Boids, a term derived from "bird-oid," is an artificial life algorithm developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986 to simulate the intricate flocking behavior observed in groups of animals, particularly birds. The algorithm's elegance lies in its simplicity, employing three basic rules that govern the motion of individual entities (boids) within a group, leading to complex and visually appealing collective patterns.

In the context of Boids 2D, this algorithm comes to life in a visually stimulating simulation. Users can observe the dynamic interplay between boids, hunters, and environmental elements like walls, experiencing firsthand how the simplicity of rules leads to the emergence of intricate and realistic group behaviors.

## Three Fundamental Rules of the Boids Algorithm:

## 1. Alignment:


   - **Rule**: Boids align their direction with the average direction of their neighbors.
   - **Purpose**: Encourages entities to move in the same general direction as nearby members, creating a sense of cohesion and alignment within the group.

## 2. Cohesion:


   - **Rule**: Boids move towards the average position of their neighbors.
   - **Purpose**: Promotes togetherness as entities are drawn towards the center of the group, preventing dispersion and fostering a cohesive flock.

### 3. Separation:

   - **Rule**: Boids avoid collisions by steering away from nearby entities.
   - **Purpose**: Prevents overcrowding and collisions by ensuring that entities maintain a minimum separation, allowing for fluid and organized group movement.

## Emergent Behavior:
The brilliance of the Boids algorithm lies in the emergence of complex behaviors from the application of these three simple rules. By following these principles, individual boids collectively exhibit mesmerizing patterns such as flocking, schooling, and herding, mirroring the natural world.
